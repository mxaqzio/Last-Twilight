		<h1 id = "Introduction"><i>Introduction</i></h1>
		<p>In my life, I find that I am always counting down by myself in endless darkness and deep loneliness. And that sudden burst of dazzling light was short and weak. I lay down quietly and looked around this dark, small square space. There was no light, no color, and no exit. I can only cry silently and scream silently. I embraced this last dazzling light, and the person's appearance became clearer.
		<br> <br>
		The final journey of my life began so simply. I move towards the bright, thermostatic animal far away from home, shining with the light of hope. Just to reach the place that was about to disappear, in the scattered light... I saw hope, and I called this small piece of beauty "hope." That is the hope of standing on the same side as something as wonderful as life, and even if my eyes cannot see it, I will still remember it forever.

		<p> The bright light in the isolation zone in the middle of the road suddenly appeared in a circular shape, and then gradually disappeared and turned dark. The light came on again, but like fireworks at night, it eventually disappeared. The air around him was dead silent, only the sound of heavy breathing could be heard, and everything in front of him became hazy again.
		<br><br>The bright light in the isolation zone in the middle of the road suddenly appeared in a circular shape, and then gradually disappeared and turned dark. The light came on again, but like fireworks at night, it eventually disappeared. The air around him was dead silent, only the sound of heavy breathing could be heard, and everything in front of him became hazy again.
		<br><br>Add molasses peach! Although the young man's eyes were hazy, he was very familiar with the surrounding environment, and he did not want to pay too much attention to the depressive atmosphere. There was no hope. Doctors started treating him a long time ago, but his vision is still improving every day? 
		<br><br>"You are Danaiyanat Koprannaphakun, right?"
		<br><br>A familiar voice sounded, and the young man confirmed.
		<br><br>"Based on the eye exam and vision test, I think things don't look good. The function of your eyes has declined since the last time you were checked. I don't want you to be too worried, but I still want you to be prepared."
		<br><br>It was becoming increasingly difficult for Day to remember what the doctor looked like. Now he can see the water and the doctor said word by word, but in fact everything is blurry. It's as if the world around you is blocked by a thick curtain of water. If he wanted to see clearly, he had to get as close as possible. But he didn't like doing it. It was like telling a stranger that he had an eye problem, even though it was a foregone conclusion. Chronic keratitis had damaged his vision for a whole year, and it just kept going. of deterioration. 
		<br><br> "How much time do I have?" The consulting room was quiet, and he broke the silence. "I really don't want to say anything negative, but I still hope that you and your home will deteriorate, and one day you may become completely blind" The doctor's voice was filled with depression. 
		<br><br> "How long?" Day said trying to remain polite, but there was anxiety in his voice. 
		<br><br> The exact number: "I can't give you an exact number. There are many possibilities. But judging from my past experience..." She stopped and took a deep breath, "I think it may not be more than six months. 
		<br><br> The young man responded politely and stood up to salute. A hand quickly supported him, and he knew it was his brother without turning around. He smelled the faint smell of his brother's cologne. His brother helped him out of the consulting room, and he almost fell down. "You wait here, I'll pay for the medicine first." 
		<br><br> While his brother was talking, he led him to sit on the hospital bench. The sounds around him made him feel like he was near a pharmacy. The young man sat glumly, and his brother left after giving a few instructions. The young man watched silently as his brother disappeared from sight. He stood up immediately, but he didn't understand why he stood up or what he wanted to do. But the words "six months" kept vibrating in his mind. He really wanted to escape from here, as far away as possible, and if possible, he never wanted to come back. 
		<br><br> Peach with molasses! The whole building was a light cream color. The young man grabbed the handrail and walked along the corridor. He planned to leave as soon as possible. He should get a taxi and go wherever he wanted to go. After that, he may start a new journey. The young man walked forward at a loss like a lost child until he reached the end of the corridor and the sun shone on the ground. He had nothing to hold on to, and he couldn't see the road ahead clearly, but he stepped out without hesitation. 
		<br><br> "Do you want flowers, little brother? Fifty baht a bunch." 
		<br><br> "Young man, do you want to buy a lottery ticket? You will be rich tomorrow." 
		<br><br> "What's the matter with you? You're walking too slowly." "Want to take a motorcycle, little brother? You decide how much it will cost." " 
		<br><br> "Would you like to order food? There is also roast pork available." 
		<br><br> "Young man, can you lend me some money? I want to find my child, but I'm lost." 
		<br><br> "Support our handmade dessert bar, we are raising funds for the Association for the Blind." 
		<br><br> Completely contrary to what he had imagined before, he became more and more confused as he walked, feeling like he was lost in a huge maze. He stumbled as he walked, his sense of direction based on his memory gradually blurring. He found that he was just following pedestrians around. He smelled all kinds of smells, but none of them were familiar to him. He wanted to find something to lean on, but the street vendor asked him to walk very carefully for fear of hitting something. "Oh my God, are you blind? Do you need help crossing the road?" 
		<br><br> asked a stranger, with a mixture of sympathy and impatience in his voice. The young man did not respond. He was heartbroken that he encountered someone with malicious intentions, and his mind was in a mess. But before he could answer, the strong arm grabbed his arm tightly and led him. He could only follow and felt that he was stepping on a slightly higher platform. He thought he had reached the end of the sidewalk. He felt dissatisfied with this unsolicited help. 
		<br><br> "Thanks." 
		<br><br> The young man said as he broke away from the stranger's hand. The voice on the other side suddenly got louder, but that was about it. He saw the man wave and leave. The crowd around him started moving again, getting farther and farther away from him. There was a sudden chill in his heart. He glanced around and realized that he had made a complete mistake. This is not a sidewalk, but the center of the road. Pedestrians passed in front and behind him. The world was starting to become chaotic and he didn't know what to do. 
		<br><br> "Is there anyone... I..." 
		<br><br> Day decided to seek help from pedestrians. He reached out to touch the shoulder of the person in front of him, but at that moment, everything became chaotic and he could only see shadows around him. A gust of wind blew, the traffic lights turned green, and the vehicles began to move again. Less than a shoulder's width away from him, a motorcycle sped past. If he had taken half a step more, he might have been hit and killed on this road. His legs were shaking uncontrollably. Since his vision became impaired, he has never acted alone. 
		<br><br> "Please..." 
		<br><br> "Help..." 
		<br><br> "Help!" 
		<br><br> His voice grew louder and louder, until it became a cry of despair. Things were constantly moving around him, and Day couldn't tell which side was the road and which was the median. He doesn't know where in the world he is now. Everything became dark, and the despair in his heart engulfed him. He tried to reach out and grab someone, but all he caught was a worn-out metal railing. Someone laughed at him from a passing vehicle. 
		<br><br> "Help!" 
		<br><br> Day screamed for help as loud as he could, but his cries were almost drowned out by the din around him. He didn't know how long he stood there. One minute? Ten minutes or more? Countless pedestrians may have passed by him, and his mind was spinning. 
		<br><br> The young man didn't want to stay here until dark, when things would get worse. After dark, it will be harder for drivers to see pedestrians. If he took even one step forward he could be hit by a car. He suddenly smiled faintly and decided to take his right leg and walk forward. What should come will always come. <br><br> Walk forward with your right leg, and what should come will always come. "What are you doing? Do you want to die?" <br><br> There was a sharp sound, and suddenly a hand tightly grabbed the young man's arm and pulled him back forcefully. Day's body hit the chest of the man yelling at him. He smelled a pungent smell of smoke. In Day's blurred vision, he was very close to the stranger in front of him, so close that he could see his faint stubble, as if it had grown out after just shaving. . The weathered skin looked very rough. From this angle, Day couldn't see the man's entire face clearly. 
		<br><br> "I can't see very well," Day stammered. 
		<br><br> "Then why are you here? Where are you going?" 
		<br><br> There was no tenderness, comfort or concern in this voice, just a straightforward inquiry. But honestly, the stranger seemed to be the only one willing to help him in this situation. 
		<br><br> "I want to go home," the young man replied dejectedly, silently accepting that it is not easy to live alone with limited vision, especially in a strange place. Now, nothing is more important than surviving. The incident still sent shivers down his spine. 
		<br><br> "Can you take a motorcycle?" the voice from the front asked. 
		<br><br> "OK." 
		<br><br> After hearing Day's answer, the stranger slowly led Day's hand to the back seat of the motorcycle. At the same time, rapid sirens sounded all around. Young people can roughly imagine how chaotic the surroundings are now. The strange man stopped his motorcycle, seemingly to rescue him from the rightmost lane. This scene undoubtedly attracted the attention of many people. As the red light turned on, people gathered in the middle of the road, and there was a lot of gossip. Day wanted to leave here as soon as possible. 
		<br><br> "Come up." 
		<br><br> The stranger shouted, starting the motorcycle at the same time. Day quickly jumped on it. He clearly recalled how to sit firmly. His feet were firmly on the pedals, but he didn't know where to put his hands because the motorcycle had no armrests. Before he could hesitate, the stranger's hand reached out and took Day's hand, holding him tightly around his waist, reminding him not to be naughty if he couldn't see. Day couldn't help but laugh. He didn't know if it was a complaint or a joke, but this was the first time Day laughed out loud today. No, it was probably the first time in months that I laughed out loud. "Thank you" 
		<br><br> Day yelled into the fast wind. He simply explained the way home to the stranger, who immediately understood. Day decided to say thanks. In his heart he wants to give back or do something to show gratitude, but he doesn't know what to do. 
		<br><br> "You're welcome, I didn't mean to help you." 
		<br><br> The voice responded coldly. The young man was a little confused by this response and didn't know what to say. 
		<br><br> "I just don't want to see anyone die in front of me...that's all." 
		<br><br> The low voice continued without any hesitation. Day couldn't help laughing and was a little surprised by this unusual reaction. He realized that he had misunderstood. If most people are willing to help, it's either out of pity or because they want to get some kind of reward, but the man in front of them is different. "What's your name?" Day asked. 
		<br><br> The man in front of him smiled, and then replied, "Mhok." 
		<br><br> This short answer seems like a joke from heaven. Day feels like his life is lost in a thick fog with no way out. But now, a stranger is willing to lend a hand to help him, and this person happens to be named "Mhok". It seems that God has arranged the most wonderful coincidence. 
		<br><br> "Do I need to tell you my name?" Day asked. 
		<br><br> "No...we may never meet again after we get to your house. Such a blunt rejection did not offend Day. On the contrary, he found himself attracted to this mysterious and forthright person. This mysterious and straightforward stranger was full of curiosity. At this moment, he felt an unspeakable regret in his heart. It would be interesting if there were more people like this in the world. 
		<br><br> "My name is Day, and it's okay if you know it or forget it, but I want to tell you...that's all.

		"Where did Day go!"﻿ <br><br> The person who shouted loudly was his mother. To Mhok, he was not surprised because Day's mother was a nationally renowned chef. The middle-aged woman started yelling as soon as she stepped into the home. Day heard the low muttering of the strange man next to him. <br><br> "It's all my fault, Mom," his brother explained. <br><br> "Can you stop pretending to be pitiful?" Day said with a hint of displeasure, "I ran out of the hospital by myself, and happened to meet a kind person who helped me, and he sent me back." He said and pointed to Mhok. <br><br> "What's wrong, Day? Where did you go? Why did you run away? Why didn't you tell your mother if something happened? What would your mother do if something happened to you?" Day's mother's voice was full of anxiety. <br><br> "If something happens to me, my mother doesn't have to do anything, because I am already like this. The doctor said that I will be completely blind in a few months. Can anyone help me? In the end, I can only rely on Myself!" His voice rose, almost becoming a roar. All the helplessness and inferiority came out at this moment. Day knew in his heart that his mother had done nothing wrong and she had always been the one who took good care of him. But he still couldn't help but feel pain, and he wanted to scream. He knows that his current behavior is bad, as if he is looking for someone to share his pain. <br><br> "I'm sorry, Mom." <br><br> After a moment of silence, the young man apologized. He heard his mother's heavy sigh, and seemed to hear it from his brother as well. <br><br> "How about canceling the nursing interview first, Mom. Day probably doesn't want to talk to anyone right now. They'll just annoy each other," Night said. <br><br> "But I have to fly to Milan tomorrow." That's all my mother said, and then she fell silent. Day raised his left hand, clearly aware. His mother wanted someone to take care of him, mostly because he had just hit the kitchen table and cut a gash on his finger. She fears the next accident might be worse than this. <br><br> "Look, Mom, I brought someone." Day turned his head and pointed at Mhok. <br><br> "What? I just sent you home, I'm ready to go now" Mhok whispered. <br><br> Day whispered, "You just need to pretend to be doing an interview. Then when you hear the salary, act dissatisfied, then you don't have to do the interview, and you can leave then." <br><br> "Why do you need me to help you? I've already done my best by sending you home." The man complained. <br><br> "First of all, you are doing a good deed, that is, helping my mother, so that she will feel at ease. You will definitely go to heaven in the future. Oh, and one more thing, I will remember to owe you a favor, no, two favors , including you taking me home. If you need help in the future, just come and tell me, but a blind person like me may not be able to help you much." <br><br> The young man said a lot, but the other party did not respond. Day saw the man walking straight up to his mother and brother, talking to them about something, but he couldn't hear clearly. He stayed there quietly. He thought Mhok would refuse directly, but luckily he didn't. His mother asked him to come to the living room to chat with her, so he had no choice but to follow in. <br><br> "What's your name? How old are you?" <br><br> "My name is Mhok, I'm 25 years old." <br><br> "Where did you graduate?" <br><br> "I graduated from a technical school." <br><br> "What job have you had before?" <br><br> "I worked various jobs, repairing cars, cleaning air conditioners, connecting electrical wiring, whatever someone hired me to do. Also, I sometimes drove a motorcycle." <br><br> Day laughed out loud. Mhok really looked like he was here for an interview. He could imagine his mother's expression when she heard the background of the person in front of him, because all the caregivers who came before were at least college graduates, or at least had some experience in nursing. System training courses. No one dares to use someone who graduated from a technical school to fill such a position. Night also asked Mhok a lot of questions, mostly about his commute, working hours and accommodation. <br><br> "The work you need to do is to help Day adapt to the possibility of blindness in the future. The doctor said he has about six months to go. During this time, Day will need to learn how to use crutches, learn Braille, and learn to take care of himself. Basic daily life, it is not convenient for him to do these things alone for the time being. This work may only be temporary until Day can adapt to it on his own." Day's mother explained in detail. <br><br> "Are you ready to get to work?" <br><br> "Tomorrow." <br><br> "The salary is 50,000, including room and board and all overtime pay. You can take one day off per week, but you need to agree with me on which day to take off first, because I need to arrange shifts." Night said. <br><br> Day smiled slightly at the thought of his mother and brother being immediately rejected by this man. <br><br> "Okay, I'll start working tomorrow," Mhok replied calmly, which surprised Day. <br><br> "Wait a moment!" <br><br> Day couldn't help but stood up and hurriedly followed the man, then pulled Mhok and asked him to go outside to chat privately. His mother and brother did not object, as they had always asked the caregiver to communicate with Day privately. <br><br> "I told you to refuse!" <br><br> Day said with a hint of annoyance as he walked out of the living room and closed the door. Mhok couldn't help but laugh, which made him angrier. <br><br> "I never said I would refuse. Although this care taker job is not so arbitrary, the salary is 50,000. If you want to earn more, you have to win the lottery." <br><br> "I don't need you to take care of me. You see, I can take care of myself." Day retorted. <br><br> "Really? Who almost lost their life on the road?" Mhok shot back. <br><br> Day felt frustrated and didn't know how to respond, but he became increasingly angry and said firmly: "I don't know, but I'm sure I don't need you to take care of me." <br><br> "Whatever you want, it's your mother who pays me, not you." Mhok chuckled. <br><br> Day was furious, but before he could snap back the door opened. Night comes out and says he has the book ready. Day is a journalism student and loves reading books. Every time he interviews a caregiver, he asks them to read aloud from a book as an interview item. Because sometimes he will ask his caregiver to read him a whole book or more, depending on his mood. <br><br> "Which one do you want to read?" Night asked. <br><br> He held a book and Day took his brother's arm back to the living room. Although he usually doesn't have a good relationship with his brother, now he wants to go against Mhok more. Day remembered that in the past, he had asked various questions to interviewees to see their reactions. For those who seemed serious, he had them read "The True Man" because it was so touching. For those who seemed nervous, he jokingly asked them to read "The Little Prince" to gauge their reactions. But for someone as vulgar as Mhok, a complex piece of literature might be required. <br><br> "Until the red star fades." He mentioned the name of a literary novel that chronicled the history of ethnic cleansing by the Khmer Rouge. It's about a blind man named Ruthira who had to escape from Phnom Penh to the Thai side. There is a carer named, Uthit, who helps him through the difficult and war-filled path. <br><br> The brother took Day to sit on his favorite chair and then walked around to the bookshelf to find the book Day mentioned. Not long after, he took out a book with a black and red cover and handed it to Mhok, who was sitting not far away. The sound of opening the book immediately sounded. <br><br> "Read it out loud and I'll tell you when to stop," Night said. <br><br> "Why are you reading this?" Mhok asked. <br><br> "Day loves to listen to books, and one of your duties is to read to him." <br><br> Mhok nodded, seeming to understand, and then he began to read as Night directed. Night chose the part about Ruthira and Uthit's escape from Phnom Penh for Mhok to read. The plot in this part is very tense, mixed with the horror of war. Mhok's voice starts out steady, but soon it becomes passionate, rising and falling with the emotional changes of the content, as if he's so immersed in the story that he forgets he's conducting an interview. Mhok's voice is alternately confused, hopeful, weak, and endlessly amused. <br><br> "boom!" <br><br> Mhok loudly imitates the sudden sound of a gunshot in the story. Day felt like he was there, so close to the mood of the characters in the book that he felt like he was Ruthira himself. <br><br> "That's it." <br><br> After that, the sound of turning pages of books stopped abruptly. Mhok didn't stumble or stutter over the complex literary work, although he sometimes mispronounced it or paused in places. But Day had never felt like a character in a book before. Mhok was not reading to Day, but to himself. <br><br> "Do you think that ‘bang' was a tire exploding or a gunshot?" <br><br> Day asked, In the story, Ruthira and Uthit were traveling with a driver, and as the two briefly left, there was a sudden "bang" sound. Uthit told Ruthira that the tire had exploded, so they had to go on foot. But Ruthira suspected the sound wasn't tires and that the driver might have been shot. <br><br> "It must have been gunfire, the driver was killed." Mhok replied without hesitation. <br><br> "Then why didn't Uthit tell Ruthira? Why did the caregiver lie to her employer?" he asked. <br><br> "Have sympathy." Mhok simply replied, "Ruthira is a blind nobleman. Just sleeping in the open air has made him feel very anxious. Uthit may be out of sympathy and dare not tell him the disturbing truth for fear that he will not be able to bear it. , a waste of energy." <br><br> "If it were you, would you tell him?" Day asked nervously. <br><br> "Yes." Mhok replied quickly, "We are not children anymore, why do we still sit here and talk about irrelevant things? Life is like this, you have to get used to it." <br><br> After Mhok finished speaking, the whole room fell silent. It seems that he also felt that he talked too much in this interview. Mom reaches out to squeeze Day's arm as if to get Day to make a decision. Day raised his head with firm eyes. A breeze blew in from the living room window, and he felt the bright light woven together with the breeze. <br><br> Maybe the person in front of me is right, life is like this, if you can't accept it, how can you continue? <br><br> "Okay, I've decided to hire you as my caretaker... but if you ever take pity on me, I'll let you go."

		<p> 
		The sound of the curtains opening mercilessly woke Day up from his deep sleep. Judging from the light coming in from the window, it was already morning. The person who woke him up was none other than Mhok, who came directly from the repairs shop. The familiar smell of cigarette smoke filled the room. Someone was definitely smoking, but the smell wasn't that pungent or overly offensive. It's even more like a perfume, but not as nice.﻿ <br><br> "It's time to get up," Mhok said softly. <br><br> "I know, stop waking me up like an alarm clock," he complained. This new caretaker, who he hadn't really gotten a good look at yet, was more of an annoyance than he'd imagined. If it were anyone else, they would be disturbed by Day's serious tone, and some would give up on the first day. But Mhok is different. No matter what you say to him, it's like talking to a wall, even if it's a joke, it's useless. Day found it difficult to deal with such people, and he was always being ordered to do this and that. He will resist at first. But the more he resisted, the more trouble he got, because the other party never gave in, so Mhok almost took him to take a bath. <br><br> "for you." <br><br> The young man reached out and took a small bottle of eye drops from Mhok. Although his vision continues to decline, eye drops can help him adjust intraocular pressure and make his vision clearer, especially in the first ten seconds after the drops are dropped. Everything seemed like a dream, all abnormalities disappeared. But this only lasts ten seconds. Day picked up the eye drops, got up from the bed, and walked to a familiar corner of the room. <br><br> "10...9...8...7...6..." <br><br> After two drops of the medicine came into contact with his eyes, the world immediately became brighter. Day stared at the large glass jar in front of him. A chubby goldfish was swimming around inside, as if saying "Good morning." He sprinkled the prepared fish food into the water, and the chubby fish swam happily over. <br><br> "5...4...3...2...1..." <br><br> Day tried to clearly remember what the only pet in his life looked like. As the owner of a goldfish, he wakes up every morning to feed it. On countless days and nights when he wished he could sleep peacefully without being disturbed by nightmares, it was this goldfish that gave him the motivation to face each day. <br><br> "0..." <br><br> Then everything becomes blurry again. Jinlu, who had been vivid before, was now a blurry orange blob, floating in the bathtub hidden by the water curtain. He took a long breath. Even though this situation was recalculated every day, it was still difficult to adapt. <br><br> "What's your name?" <br><br> "My nickname is Day, my real name is Danaiyanat, my surname is Kopranpakhun, I am twenty years old. Do you still want to hear my ID number?" <br><br> "Has anyone ever said you were naughty?" <br><br> Mhok whispered, causing Day to laugh. He laughed happily for a while, and then slowly developed a strange feeling. Ever since that day that changed his life, he hadn't laughed like this for many days, many months, maybe a year. <br><br> "JinSay. " <br><br> "what does that mean?" <br><br> "life." <br><br> Day replied calmly, and the room fell silent again. The young man himself couldn't guess what the other person was thinking. But soon, he heard a crunching sound, like hands rubbing against a glass jar. <br><br> "But I think your Jinsay is dying." Mhok said quietly. <br><br> "What?" Day asked confused. <br><br> "The water has not been changed, and the rocks are covered with algae. Have you cleaned it? Soon, you will find the body of this fish floating in the fish tank." Mhok complained while wiping the fish tank, making an annoying sound the sound of. <br><br> "Why don't you clean it up quickly? What are you waiting for?" he complained. <br><br> "I'm going out with you to clean up. Don't let my fish die, or you will die in its place." <br><br> "I thought you wouldn't leave the bedroom," Mhok shot back quickly. <br><br> "hurry up!" <br><br> The young man hurriedly urged the other party to clean the fish tank quickly. Mhok then set up a table in the middle of the garden and wiped it clean. Day is sitting not far away. Mhok kept mumbling as he worked. He didn't ask any questions, he just described what he was doing - removing the goldfish, scrubbing the rocks, changing the water, etc. This made Mhok's appearance vivid in Day's mind. <br><br> Day felt something inside him. Mhok may seem a bit rough and direct, and almost never speaks softly, but he is probably the most willing to put himself in other people's shoes. <br><br> "It's done." <br><br> Mihok said after about thirty minutes. Day moved closer to the glass tank, and the scene before him became clearer than before. The cute goldfish swims happily, probably happy that someone is cleaning its home, so it keeps swimming around. <br><br> "Take me back to my room." <br><br> "Why go back in a hurry?" said Mhok, who was indifferent to the request. "The flowers in the yard are blooming. What kind of plant is this?" smells good. The atmosphere here is much better than the gloomy bedroom. I don't know why you like to stay in the room so much." <br><br> "As you wish." <br><br> The young man frowned, annoyed by the criticism in front of him. But Mhok was not angry, on the contrary, he smiled secretly. He stepped back, grabbed Day's hand, and placed what looked like a flower in his hand. <br><br> "Smell the flowers, it can help relieve anxiety." <br><br> Even though Day didn't really want to follow Mhok's instructions, he had to admit that the atmosphere in the garden was indeed very good. Since losing his normal vision, the young man has always wanted to be alone and almost never leaves his room. He would even eat in his bedroom unless necessary, leaving the house only for doctor's appointments. <br><br> Day decided to let time pass slowly, smelling the fragrance of the flower in his hand, he wasn't even sure what kind of flower it was. "Oh, has Day come back from the United States? Why didn't Night tell me?" A girl's voice came into their ears. It sounded like it was not far away, maybe coming from the front door. He recognized the voice of one of Night's female friends. A strong feeling immediately came to his heart. He didn't want anyone in the world to know that he had a problem with his eyesight, especially acquaintances, because that would inevitably lead to him being entangled in the thing he hates most in his life... that is pity. . <br><br> "Take me back to my room right now." <br><br> "but..." <br><br> "Now!" His voice was urgent and frustrated, all of which showed the seriousness of the situation. Mhok immediately grabbed his arm and dragged him away from the noisy crowd. It seemed that Night had brought some friends home and unfortunately today they were getting particularly loud, the yelling mixed with the sounds of his brother trying to control and calm the situation but the young man no longer cared about anything. He wanted to be as far away from everyone as possible, away from everyone's scrutiny and suspicion. <br><br> "Just leave me alone. Don't come into my room again until I call you." <br><br> Day demanded sternly, no trace of softness in his tone. He felt Mhok's embarrassment and nervousness, but he didn't want to care too much. Mhok, like everyone else, couldn't last long. He doesn't need to establish intimacy or trust with anyone. He has had ten caregivers, Mhok is just one of them. <br><br> "go out..." <br><br> The young man's voice was firm enough to make the hesitant person back away after putting down the fish tank. Day closed the door and returned to his own world. He first closed the curtains and escaped into the darkness. He took off all his clothes, grabbed a towel, and went into the bathroom to take a cold shower to calm his uneasiness. <br><br> Day soaked in the bathtub, playing soft music. He put a towel in the bathtub and lay quietly in the water, letting his body be surrounded by the cool water. His breathing slowly slowed down, and his heart was beating heavily with various thoughts. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to fall asleep. <br><br> "Da da." The sound seemed to come from far away. <br><br> "Da da..." The voice gradually came closer. <br><br> Make a sound! Not far away, Yi Hanquan's loud voice startled the young man who had accidentally hit Li Shou in the bathtub, making him sit up in fright. <br><br> "Who is there!" <br><br> There was silence. <br><br> "I said, who's there!" <br><br> "It's me...Mhok." <br><br> The sound felt like a cold current from the top of Day's head to his toes. Mhok what right do you have to barge into the bathroom and most importantly, how could he see Day naked like this? <br><br> "I was afraid something would happen to you. I called for a while, but no one answered. I didn't have the key, so I had to rush in. I was afraid there was an emergency." <br><br> This may be the first time Day heard Mhok speak less harshly than usual, but also with a gentle heart. But no matter what the reason was, it was something he couldn't stand. His heart was beating uncontrollably, faster and faster, as if it was about to explode. Becoming a bullet ready to shoot anyone who forced him into this predicament. <br><br> "I want you to leave my home immediately."

		<p> 
		"Teacher...Teacher...Teacher Day!" (*This word comes from the Thai a75, which means teacher or professor. This is the affectionate and slightly joking name given to Day by Aon, a volunteer of the Association for the Visually Impaired.)﻿ <br><br> A series of shouts woke the young man from his sleep. He swallowed to relieve the dryness in his throat, then turned his head and called "Aon." He often calls the person in front of him Aon, brother, or Aon, teacher. Aon is a volunteer from the Association for the Visually Impaired and will come to the homes of new visually impaired patients to talk, share experiences, and provide life guidance. Outside of his family, Day feels most comfortable talking to Aon about his visual impairment, sometimes even more comfortably than talking to his mother or brother. <br><br> "You called me teacher? Oh... don't scare me." Day pretended to complain. "Then what should I call you? I have taught you to walk four or five times with a cane, but you are just there silently facing me. If I were a junior visually impaired person, I would think you are a ghost. You lied to me. But, I am a high-level blind person." Aon said this very affectionately, but in fact, Aon was nearly a year older than Day. <br><br> "Do it again, teacher." <br><br> The young man held out his hand and was handed a cane. He began trying to learn to walk with a cane, following Ann's instructions. He has refused to learn how to use a cane and Braille. Deep down, he always told himself that his eyes would heal soon. But now, he wanted to make up for something, he wanted to apologize to someone. If you feel guilty, go apologize to him. He is not a mind reader and cannot hear your inner apology. "The person next to him said. After hearing these words, Day stopped waving his cane. He didn't know whether he should feel uneasy because of the sharp words, or he was shocked that Aon could read him so accurately. Feelings. Day felt very sorry for Mhok. Looking back, Mhok was not wrong at all. Even if Mhok saw him when he was not wearing clothes, it was really for his safety. To put it another way, if he really had an accident , if Mhok didn't help him, his life might be in danger. <br><br> "I...." <br><br> Before Day could respond, the doorbell rang. The corners of his mouth turned up unconsciously, and he sincerely hoped it was Mhok. If Mhok comes, it means he is not angry anymore and has forgotten about his dismissal for now. <br><br> "I'll go take a look." Night said. Day was ready and excited, mentally sure it must be Mhok because his mother never rang the doorbell. As for who else might come to the house, he couldn't think of any. Day stood quietly, fiddling with the crutch in his hand unconsciously. Footsteps crept down the aisle until the door opened. Night indicated that the visitor wanted to talk privately and returned to his room. <br><br> "Hello Day, my name is Porjai and I'm Mhok's friend." <br><br> The person speaking was a woman. In his blurry vision, Day could see a woman with long hair and a slender figure. That's all he could see, and he was disappointed to find that the person in front of the painting wasn't Mhok, and his palms began to turn watery. <br><br> "Did Mhok ask you to collect his salary for him?" His voice was a little dry. <br><br> "No." She shook her head. "Your mother transferred the money to Mhok yesterday. But he had something to give you and he couldn't come in person." <br><br> Porjai handed over a bag with some embarrassment, and Day took it with confusion. Feeling what was inside, he realized they were a pair of large soft-toed slippers. It made him feel even more guilty, thinking about the injury he'd had on his toe since he first met Mhok. Although he never bumped into anything at home again, the other person never forgot. <br><br> "What's the pattern on the shoes?" he asked curiously. <br><br> "It's a goldfish," Porjai replied. "If there's nothing else, I'll leave first. This is what Mhok asked me to give." <br><br> The person in front of him turned around to leave after saying that, and Day was in a mess inside. <br><br> "Teacher Day..." Aon's voice was very soft, but it contained a lot of things, and Day finally made up his mind. <br><br> "Miss Porjai," shouted the young man, causing the departing man to stop and turn around. <br><br> "Can you take me to Mhok? I have something I want to talk to him about." <br><br> Day and Porjai went out together. Day did not tell his brother and chose to leave quietly. He added a car on his phone and headed to Mhok's house. On the way, he had been worrying about what he would say to Mhok when he arrived. <br><br> How does he respond if the other person gets angry and starts an argument? <br><br> "We're almost there, Day. Almost five minutes," Porjai told him after the car turned into an alley. The environment here is quite crowded, and it is not difficult to guess that Mhok's family conditions may not be that good. <br><br> "What do Mhok's parents do?" Day couldn't help but ask. <br><br> "Mhok's parents died when he was a child. Mhok grew up with two sisters, and he lost his sister last year. Mhok acted strong, that's all. But apart from his sister, his life was almost empty. Who's left, me too." Porjai said a lot, but suddenly realized that she was sharing too much about Mhok's personal affairs and decided to remain silent. Day pursed his lips, realizing just now that he barely knew the man who had saved his life. <br><br> "Didn't he have a regular job before he became my carer?" Day decided to ask further. <br><br> Porjai sighed heavily, as if something was weighing on his heart, but he finally spoke out. "Not at all, Day. Mhok used to be a very rebellious person and he made a lot of money while working in a repair shop. He even used the money to pay for his sister's car loan, which was the last thing his sister Rung left him. Otherwise, someone like him might not even think about taking care of others because he can't even take good care of himself." Porjai's last sentence seemed like a joke, but her tone of concern showed how much she felt towards Mhok. of concern. <br><br> "Sorry for taking up a lot of your boyfriend's time, and I drove him away rudely, even though he did nothing wrong." Day seemed to have some power in his heart that urged him to say this. <br><br> "Well... As for what you said, Mhok and I did date, but we broke up almost five years ago. I already have a new boyfriend and we are about to get married. But as you can imagine, Mhok and I have been We are very close and have never really left each other. Especially now that he has no one else around, if we can help each other, we will try our best to help each other." <br><br> The car stopped, as if to signal the end of the conversation. Day opened the car door and got out, and Porjai came over to greet him. Before the car drove away, Porjai took Day slowly into the house. She seemed to be familiar with the place and easily opened the door with the key. He walked excitedly, unable to form any images in his mind. What he could see was a small house, probably with two floors and not many living rooms. Near the door, there was a motorcycle parked. Porjai opened the door and took him into the house. <br><br> "Porjai, is that you? What a coincidence. Can you help me find out if this is soy sauce or soybean paste? These flavors make me dizzy." <br><br> Mhok's voice came from inside the house. Porjai leads Day inside. Arriving in the kitchen, Day smelled an aroma. Mhok just stood there and Day made no move to say hello. <br><br> "What are you doing? Are you crazy?" Porjai yelled in surprise. <br><br> "I was just trying to see if I could make soup without seeing it, I'm not crazy," Mhok explained casually, handing a bottle of spices to Porjai. <br><br> "Why are you doing this with your eyes closed, are you idle? Are you playing some strange game?" Porjai complained, but still told him the name of the condiment he was handed. <br><br> "I just wanted to know what it would be like to not be able to see." Those words echoed in Day's mind. <br><br> "Even in such a short period of time, I felt so uncomfortable. If I had to live like this for a year or a few years, I might be so depressed that I want to die." After speaking, he let out a long sigh. <br><br> Standing in someone else's home as an uninvited guest seemed a bit uncomfortable. Day had never thought before that Mhok would want to try so hard to understand him. Everyone who comes into his life, regardless of their status, looks at him with sympathy, seeing him as a helpless bird. But this man is not. He is willing to feel and understand his helplessness from his perspective, supporting him and accepting him like a true friend. <br><br> A tear slipped from the corner of Day's eye. For the first time since his world went dark, he met someone who tried to understand him. <br><br> "If you can see, open your eyes. Closing your eyes doesn't make me see," Day joked. <br><br> "Day!" <br><br> Mhok shouted in surprise, and Day saw in his blurred vision that the man in front of the stove hurriedly took off his blindfold, turned off the fire, and walked directly to him. <br><br> "How did you get here?" <br><br> "Maybe it's a superpower." <br><br> "Wow... this joke is quite profound. Fortunately, I am studying mechanics and know a little bit about it. Do you have anything to do with me?" Mhok asked while laughing. <br><br> "Yes..." He paused, "Why don't you come to work? You haven't passed the probation period yet, why are you in such a hurry to resign?" <br><br> "Because you fired me." <br><br> "Oh, didn't you say that my mother hired you? - I didn't pay your salary, so why should you listen to me? You can go back to work, otherwise my mother will really fire you this time, really." <br><br> Mhok laughed, trying to find ways to escape being fired, but all failed. Day also smiled and did not continue or explain anything. It was easy to let Mhok leave without any delay or obstruction. <br><br> "Just leave like this..." Mhok asked. <br><br> "Wait a minute," Day said. "I want to try the soup made by a man who wants to go blind to see if it's really edible. I'm the son of a famous chef. If it doesn't taste good, just wait to be criticized by me. . The young man blushed a little when he said this, and he slowly walked to the table in the middle of the kitchen that could be used for dining. He pulled out a chair and sat down happily. PorJai told Mhok that he had to go to work, and Mhok told He didn't have to worry, he'd take care of the rest. Mhok happily closed the door and ladled the soup into a bowl, but didn't add any rice. <br><br> "If it tastes good, don't ask me to make it again. My labor costs are very expensive." Mhok said half-jokingly. <br><br> "Did anyone ask for it?" <br><br> "Tough talk." <br><br> The other person responded loudly, as if on purpose. Day frowned, then tasted the soup in his hand. He originally thought it would taste terrible. But surprisingly, it tasted pretty good. Although it's not an out-of-this-world delicacy, it's much better than the soup in ordinary fast food restaurants. Just one taste and he knew he wasn't using instant soup packets. The meat is simmered and black pepper is sprinkled on top for added texture. The vegetables are cooked just right, with just the right amount of softness and hardness, and just the right amount of sweetness. <br><br> "Is it tasty?" <br><br> He didn't answer and took another bite. <br><br> "Is it delicious?" <br><br> Day still didn't respond and continued eating happily. He finished the meat, the bowl was empty, and he shrugged, his face looking nothing special. <br><br> "Just, it's not bad."

		"I really hope you'll read this book, it's really interesting. But I don't want to spoil it for you. You should read it for yourself anyway."﻿ <br><br> Aon said when he visited Day's home the next week. In fact, Day's teacher always recommended some interesting books to him, especially short stories that were interesting and thought-provoking. But the book he is recommending now is an unusual old book written by a foreigner who came to Thailand to live temporarily. After being translated into a book once, it disappeared from the market. Aon himself read it after borrowing someone else's book and said he shouldn't miss it no matter what. <br><br> "Last Twilight. " <br><br> Day was still mumbling the title of the book as Aon left. He was very curious about what the book was about, but the recommender was vague and unwilling to reveal too much. He only said that he must read it himself, but did not leave the book to him. <br><br> "It's really hard to find." <br><br> Seeing Day sitting quietly, Whok raised his voice and tried to search on shopping websites, hoping that some online stores still stock this book. However, it seems like every store is out of stock, even second-hand malls on various apps. <br><br> "Brother Aon, brother Aon, piqued our interest, and then left. Why don't you go online and see if anyone has spoiled the story? Even if brother Aon doesn't say it, there must be others who will. Now that I'm like this But I can't sleep well." Day said with a resentful tone. <br><br> "Actually, there is another place. No matter how rare the bad book is, it can be found there. It just depends on one's ability." Mhok said, and Day felt the other party laughing. <br><br> "Where?" <br><br> "The second-hand bookstore in Khanducha," Mhok said. "I sold clothes there for a while." One bookstore seller boasted that they had a variety of I-Day books. Even if it's not available elsewhere, it can be found in them. I think this book must be there. " <br><br> Before Day could say anything, Mhok hurriedly picked up the phone and called the bookstore owner. Day was waiting nervously, he couldn't hear the voice on the other end of the phone clearly, so he could only wait for Mhok to end the call and tell him what was said. <br><br> "He said he had it, but he didn't know where it was in the store. If we want it, we have to go find it ourselves, otherwise he won't find it for us," Mhok said after hanging up the phone. <br><br> "I can go look for it on my next day off," he continued. <br><br> "No, we'll go today, I'll go with you." Day said decisively. <br><br> "Are you serious?" Mhok asked again, but he didn't argue too much. <br><br> "If I don't read this book today, I will definitely not be able to sleep. This book must be related to the blind." The young man clenched his fists and said firmly. <br><br> "But I can go alone. Aren't you afraid that your mother will scold you if you leave like this?" Mhok objected. <br><br> "As long as you don't let my mother know, just go and come back early. If I let you go alone, what if you buy the wrong book? How many books can you read in a year?" Day was a little impatient, because the other party kept Asking questions, he rubbed his hands on the wall, obviously not wanting to wait any longer. If the delay continued, he would call a taxi himself. But before he could walk out of the room, a familiar hand grabbed him, put his hand on his arm, and led him to continue walking. <br><br> Day smelled the faint smell of cigarette smoke lingering around him, making him dizzy. Since his vision became blurred, he relied more on other senses, and many memories were hidden in these intricate feelings. <br><br> Mhok took Day to the car called from the app. Along the way, Day seemed a little uneasy. He took out his headphones and listened to the music on his phone, which calmed his confused mood. Mhok sat in the back seat with him. It went on and on as usual - mentioning where they were, what their surroundings were like, what the traffic jam was like. Even though Day didn't ask this, it didn't bother him, and no other caregiver had done this before. <br><br> "We're here," Mhok said. <br><br> Mhok took Day out of the car, and the fever subsided. The young people have not been to Chatuchak for a long time and have almost forgotten what it looks like here. Since falling ill, he has hardly been anywhere except the hospital. His university teacher strongly advised him to suspend his studies. He entrusted Night to manage university affairs on his behalf and deceived everyone that he had gone abroad. As for those social media software, he no longer uses them at all. <br><br> "Is anyone staring at me?" Day asked. The scene must have been strange because Day had to hold Mhok's arm the whole time and walk like a blind man. <br><br> "There are a few, but most are smiling shyly," Mhok said softly. <br><br> "Shy? What are you shy about?" Day was confused. <br><br> "They probably thought we were a new couple just falling in love because you kept holding on to my arm and didn't want to let go." <br><br> Mhok laughed as he explained, and Day looked at him dumbfounded. He turned around and looked around, wondering if someone was really staring at them as Mhok said. He was annoyed by the opponent's constant teasing. He clenched his right hand and punched the opponent ten times. Although the punch was not light, it was not heavy. This immediately made the person in front of him groan in pain. <br><br> "You hit hard, you know that? Are you a boxer?" Mhok complained. <br><br> "I'm a badminton player, but my punches are probably as good as a boxer, want to try again?" Day said threateningly, and Mhok continued to lead him slowly without further argument. It seemed that he had been deliberately taken to a small alley with fewer people to make his walk more comfortable. Day was a little relieved because of this, feeling that he was no longer the center of attention. <br><br> "What is that?" The young man who had been following suddenly stopped and pointed to a shop displaying various products. Mhok also stopped and turned to look. "A clothing store, what's wrong?" He looked a little confused. <br><br> "What's that green and orange thing?" he continued. <br><br> "A shirt...just a regular shirt. Only it's very brightly colored, like a fire brigade uniform," Mhok said with a half smile. Day frowned in approval and left the store. Soon after, they arrived at the destination of their trip, a second-hand bookstore. The store owner told them to look around and the book would be somewhere in the store. <br><br> The young man glanced around the place and felt a little discouraged. The store in question was a second-hand bookstore, and it was packed with so many books that it looked very cluttered, and you had to find them one by one, and this store probably had at least one or two books. <br><br> The shop owner and Mhok separated to check the piles of books stacked together in the center of the shop, which was the most troublesome to find. At first they all told Day to just sit back and wait, but eventually he couldn't help but join the search for the book. He approached the bookshelf, almost pressing his face to the spines of the books, looking over them one by one, thinking that he might be lucky enough to encounter a miracle. Day watched unhurriedly, taking the opportunity to find some other books he wanted to read. He went through everything from Nicholas's sweet love novels to Haruki Murakami's magical realism books to Jese's documentary stories. "You...come here quickly!" Day shouted excitedly to Mhok. The other party hurriedly ran over. Day asked with a trembling voice if he had found the right book. Day handed the somewhat worn-looking book to Mhok for inspection, and then he opened the picture on the web page to compare it to make sure it was the correct book. <br><br> "By the way, this is it!" <br><br> "Yeah! Found it, bro! We found it, bro!" <br><br> Day grabbed Mhok's hand and shook it happily, shouting with excitement. Mhok looked at him and smiled happily. However, after a few seconds, Day snapped back to his senses and quickly let go of Mhok's hand, then concealed his embarrassment by picking up the book again to look at it. <br><br> "What did you call me just now?" <br><br> Mhok asked, but Day didn't understand. <br><br> "What did you call me just now?" <br><br> Mhok asked again and this time Day understood. <br><br> "I call you brother...you are older. So, I should call you brother, right? Like the motorcycle drivers and taxi drivers in front of my house, I also call them brother. What's wrong? Should I call you uncle Mhok?" Day argued. <br><br> "It's okay, I didn't say anything." <br><br> Mhok chuckled and left with Day after paying the shop owner for the book. Mhok suggested finding something to eat nearby to fill his stomach, but Day was still hesitant because he didn't want to eat outside, and he would feel a little sorry if he ate messily in the store. However, his growing hunger made him change his mind and he decided to drink orange juice. Mhok said he would take him to a vegetarian restaurant he frequented. <br><br> The two of them walked through the bustling market alleys again. As they spend more time together, Day becomes more and more accustomed to having Mhok as his compass. <br><br> He realized that this trip was the closest thing to getting out and having fun. Day held the book happily, going out wasn't as scary as he thought. But at this moment, the noise in the distance began to get louder and louder. It seemed that someone was quarreling and gradually escalated. <br><br> "There was a couple arguing." <br><br> Mhok whispered and Day could hear it a little if he paid attention. The woman's voice grew louder. Forcing the other person to decide who they want to be with. From the looks of it, it seems that the man is having an affair. The sounds of the crowd of passers-by became louder and louder. Quarrel between lovers seems to have become a kind of entertainment for everyone. Mhok also led him closer and whispered that they would pass an orange juice shop in a while. <br><br> "Damn it, Keng!" <br><br> Before the quarreling couple could finish speaking, Mhok suddenly rushed forward and shouted a scolding. That high-pitched sound is terrifying. Day recalled that Porjai once said that when he was with Mhok before, Mhok was a troublemaker, which should be correct. <br><br> "Who is this woman, Porjai, what does this mean?" This confrontation seemed to make the young man forget everything. Mhok rushed forward and faced the man named Keng with an angry face. Day began to understand what was happening. Porjai's words came to mind again, the man he planned to marry... <br><br> Is it this person? Day's heart suddenly became cold, and he began to sympathize with the two women. He felt heartbroken. But before he could react, the food flew away and there was a crash: a fight apparently broke out between Mhok and Keng. People around began to become noisy. Some people wanted to get closer to see what was going on, while others wanted to stay away from the scene. The scene became very chaotic. <br><br> Day tried to call out to Mhok, but it was in vain. He was pushed away from the scene and gradually moved away from the center of the commotion, feeling somewhat lost. He looked left and right, but couldn't see anything clearly, and his eyes were in chaos. He tried to ask or call for help, hoping someone would respond, but no one could hear him. The crowd pushed him further and further away. Mhok's voice, his only support now, grew smaller and smaller and eventually disappeared entirely. Day felt desperate and tried to pick up his phone. <br><br> However, the young man left his shoulder bag to Mhok.. Now, he was completely lost in a world of darkness.

		"Brother Mhok..."﻿ <br><br> Young people shouted in the chaotic crowd. The appearance of the people around him became blurry. He asked people for help, but everyone shunned him, as if he were some weird being that shouldn't be approached. Day called the man's name again, and again. He dragged his uncontrollable legs and walked blankly among the unfamiliar crowd, his mind went blank and he couldn't find the direction at all. Fear fell in his heart, and his eyes became dark. Thinking about what if you can't go home? What should he do. <br><br> "Day..." <br><br> He seemed to hear someone calling his name softly. Although the voice was familiar, he could not determine the direction. The noise around him disrupted his sense of direction. The young man tried to walk back, trying to find the direction he had come from. He ran in what he thought was the right direction, but was wrong. After the sound disappeared, he stopped and tried to walk back, but he only saw expressionless people walking around, and no one cared about him. He felt like he was blindfolded and running blindly in a maze. Only a deceptive voice tempted him, which made him feel relieved for a moment, but nothing could help him. <br><br> "Day!" <br><br> The sound came again, but Day still couldn't find his way. He looked around desperately, aware of his vision. Something was different this time, though. He saw bright greens and oranges swaying along one of the aisles. He ran over in a hurry, and the voice gradually became clearer until it seemed to be close to his ears. The man in green clothes waved two other bright orange clothes, and then hugged him tightly with his arms, as if he was stronger than ever. <br><br> "I'm sorry, Day.. I'm really sorry." <br><br> The deep hug brought Day to tears. He pressed his face tightly against the man's thick chest, trying to hide the vulnerability deep inside him. He was very scared. How could people like him survive without help from others? Day didn't complain about the other person letting go of his hand. That apology took away all the insecurity and frustration, Mhok was probably in the same conflict and confusion, they were no different. <br><br> "go home." <br><br> "Well, let's go home." <br><br> Mhok said and Day simply responded. The two stood up, straightened their hair and clothes, and then walked together through a narrow path. The young man took a deep breath and thought that at least today was not in vain. He had got the book he wanted. When he got home later, he wanted Mhok to read it to him so that he could completely forget about today's unpleasantness. <br><br> The two waited for a while and soon got into the car that Mhok called through the mobile app. The carriage was quiet enough to hear the voice on the other end of the phone. <br><br> (I have broken up with him.) <br><br> Day remembered that it was Porjal's voice. <br><br> "Is this the end? You think about it carefully. I didn't force you to break up, I just called to know the situation. You can do whatever you want, I won't interfere." <br><br> Mhok tried to speak as softly as possible, and Day pretended to be asleep, which would make the people next to him feel more at ease. <br><br> [Actually, I have tolerated him for a long time. He had hit me before when he was drunk. I forgave him once, but this time I just couldn't bear it. If I continue to put up with him, he won't stop his bad behavior in the future. ] <br><br> "Did he really hit you?" <br><br> It was clear in Mhok's voice that he was trying to control his emotions. There was no response from the other end of the phone, as if he had acquiesced. He took a long breath and continued. <br><br> "What about your children? You are already two months pregnant." <br><br> Day was confused and confused and disturbed. <br><br> [I may go to a hotel near my company to spend the night tonight. I have moved everything out of his dormitory. I am afraid that he will go crazy and do something unscrupulous when he comes back. ] <br><br> "If you need, you can stay at my house first. My sister's room is empty and the key is still in the original place." Mhok said calmly. <br><br> [but...] <br><br> "Stay at my house, he doesn't dare to come to you. At least I can protect you there until things calm down. Let's talk about the rest." Mhok ended the conversation like this, and the person on the other end of the phone accepted his suggestion and said that he would be at his house tonight See you, then hung up the phone. <br><br> Day was still pretending to sleep, adjusting his breathing to make it look like he was sleeping, when he heard Mhok chuckle slightly, but didn't say anything. <br><br> But after a while Day actually fell asleep. \When Mhok woke him up and told him that he had arrived home, the gray sky and the dim lights around told him that it was night. Mhok opened the door and led him inside. Day was thinking about whether to let Mhok read the newly bought book to him, and he thought that Mhok must be very tired too. <br><br> "Who gave you permission to take Day out of the house?" <br><br> The serious voice sounded from the moment they stepped into the house. How could his mother come back? Shouldn't she be in Milan now, planning kitchens for a hotel there, where she would be staying for at least a month; but here she was. Day tried to see clearly, but there was no doubt that it was indeed his mother. <br><br> "I asked Mhok to take me out," he replied firmly, not giving Mhok a chance to answer. "If you want to blame anyone, it's me, don't blame him." <br><br> Day took a step forward, as if to say he was willing to take responsibility. <br><br> "But even if Day's life is saved, you have no right to take him away from home. I have already said that you are not allowed to take Day out of the house without me or Night's company. If something happens, how will you be responsible?" Day's mother scolded Mhok severely. <br><br> "Mom!" Day tried to argue. <br><br> "Look at what you are like now. Why are you in such a mess? Did you have a conflict with someone? Don't think that I don't know your past. I know what you have done before." Mom said breathlessly, "About your past I also know about the imprisonment." <br><br> After my mother's fierce accusation, the whole room fell into silence, so quiet that everyone's breathing could be heard. The breeze blew into the living room, and the smell of Night's perfume told Day that he was also there, but he didn't say anything. <br><br> Hearing about Mhok's new past from his mother gave Day very mixed emotions. He had never considered the word "prison" before. Porjai once mentioned the word "criminal record", but Day just thought that it might be some trivial matter at most, such as a fight or being detained, where you can go home after paying a fine. <br><br> "I didn't hide it deliberately, but you didn't mention this issue during the interview. But if you feel that my past imprisonment is an unforgivable mistake... I am willing to resign." <br><br> Mhok lowered his head, his disappointed tone completely audible. Day had never known Mhok like this before and had no idea how much social hurt and condemnation he had experienced. <br><br> "No, you are not allowed to leave... I will not allow you to leave." <br><br> "Day!" <br><br> Mhok gestured to Day to stop talking, while his mother almost shouted his name in anger and disappointment. Day heard his brother trying to comfort his mother and calm her down. At this moment, the four people in Hongjian are equally nervous, and everyone has their own troubles and burdens. <br><br> "I don't think that being in prison will affect his ability to take care of me. Brother Mhok takes care of me and understands me better than the so-called professional caregivers my mother has seen. Everyone deserves to be forgiven Chance, right, mom? If he really did something wrong, I will be the first one to ask him to leave." The young man said decisively, and then specifically instructed Mhok to let him go upstairs for a sleepover party. <br><br> "It's okay, Mom, I'll keep an eye on him. There shouldn't be any serious problems. And Mhok is in jail just because no one vouched for him, not because he robbed someone's home." <br><br> Nght spoke for the first time tonight. It seemed like he was asking everyone to take a step back. Mhok quietly led Day into the bedroom. Day sat on the bed, trying to sort out the chaotic thoughts in his head. Mhok walked over and opened the curtains. The sky had darkened, and the scene outside was almost the same whether the window was open or not. <br><br> "If you look carefully, can you see it?" Mhok asked, then walked over, holding a plastic bag filled with unknown things in his hands, and let him try to touch it. Day picked up the thing in his hand and looked at it up close, almost to his nose. That's a fat goldfish. Mhok said he bought it at Chatuchak market. <br><br> "I bought it to keep you company Jinsey. I saw it sitting there alone and might feel lonely." There was a little sadness in his voice <br><br> "What's its name?" Day asked. <br><br> "It's called Nozomi," Mhok replied, "which means hope." <br><br> After Jinsey's owner agreed, Mhok took Nozomi to meet new friends. Fortunately, there is not much difference between the water temperature in the bag and the water temperature in the fish tank, so the moving process is not troublesome. Day stood and watched quietly as the man and the goldfish got to know each other. Even though everything he saw was as blurry as a pale watercolor painting, he still stared intently. <br><br> "I'm going back first." The man in bright green clothes said, while making a show of leaving the room. <br><br> "If you don't come to work tomorrow, I will follow you and beat you until you come back. I already know where your home is, don't think I dare not go." Day expressed his thoughts without hesitation. <br><br> "Day!" <br><br> "Today is my first time leaving home. I am very excited and nervous. I am afraid of other people's eyes, afraid of being laughed at, and becoming the laughing stock of others. But you know what? In fact, no one cares about me. Only me, always Overshared fear keeps me stuck." Mhok stood quietly for a while after listening to Day's words. Day felt like he didn't have a good handle on his emotions; he didn't know how to express that feeling well. <br><br> "If you don't want others to judge you, stop judging yourself too." <br><br> Day continued to finish his sentence. Mhok had an expression of relief on his face, and Day also smiled. He began to change the topic. He picked up the book he bought before and read it. <br><br> "Do you need to rush back to Porjai?" he asked. <br><br> "Oh, it turns out you were pretending to sleep just now. I thought you were asleep." <br><br> Mhok smiled as he spoke, but also looked slightly nervous. Before Day realizes she accidentally let something slip, it's too late. <br><br> "You don't need to laugh if you know it, so are you in a hurry to go back?" <br><br> "No need to worry, nothing will happen if you go back. Day, what can you do?" <br><br> "Read to me." <br><br> Then, a story about a little boy's journey begins. The little boy found that he slowly began to become blurry, but he could be seen in the sunlight. Therefore, the little boy must use every possible means to find a way to allow his body to continue to exist. Even if there is despair and confusion in front of him, there is still hope. <br><br> "Do you think I will disappear one day?" Day asked Mhok, but there was no response.

		<p> 
		The car was filled with soft music, and young people were humming along to the melody of 1990s songs. Mhok stopped the car to get money to pay the installment of a second-hand car he had guaranteed for his sister. After Mhok asked to drive out to prevent the battery from aging, Day also came out with him. The two people started a short trip, but the trip had to end before the sun went down. This time they didn't have to worry about Day's mother scolding her, as she had just flown back to Milan to deal with some contract paperwork before she returned.﻿ <br><br> "Do you want to go somewhere? But it can only be nearby. If you go too far, your brother will suspect that we drove away." When the red light turned on, Mhok stopped the car and asked. After hearing this, Day shook his head and said there was no place in particular he wanted to go. In fact, he is no longer as opposed to leaving home as he once was. But since he hasn't gone out to see the outside world for a long time, he has nowhere to go. When the traffic light turned green, Mhok sped off. At this time, the young man heard a loud horn sound from behind, which seemed to be not far from him. He frowned, feeling a little confused, and the voice didn't mean to stop. <br><br> "Did we break any traffic laws? Did someone blow their horns to tell us to leave?" Day asked. <br><br> "No, I was driving normally. But the car behind us kept following us and kept honking its horn. Maybe our trunk door was not closed properly. I stopped to check." Mhok explained, preparing to pull over. Before Mhok could get out of the car, Day's car window was suddenly knocked, and someone shouted his name outside. Day's mood suddenly became very confusing and heavy, and he heard his name, and he would never forget that sound. <br><br> "Gee!" <br><br> Day opened the car window and couldn't believe that he would meet his good friend Gee again under such circumstances. <br><br> "Have you come back from the United States? I called you, but you didn't answer, and you didn't reply to my messages." Gee was a little emotional. <br><br> "I'm sorry, Gee. I have something else to do, I'm leaving first." Day tried to close the car window and escape. <br><br> "Day...what happened to you? Why didn't you tell me? Do you still consider me a friend?" <br><br> The word "friend" came out of Gee's mouth, causing the young man sitting in the car to stop. This word gave him a big shock. Day. changed his mind and rolled down the window, trying to make eye contact with Gee as much as possible. <br><br> "Gee...I'm going blind." <br><br> This sentence instantly destroyed the barrier built between the two friends over the past year. Gee canceled her Grab order and took a car with Day to the university. During this time, the two friends had a chance to talk openly while Mhok listened quietly. <br><br> Day first experienced vision loss when he was competing in the men's badminton doubles match for the Singapore national team when his vision suddenly became blurred until it went completely black. He was later diagnosed with chronic keratitis and never returned to society. <br><br> "So how are you doing now?" Gee asked, reaching out to take Day's hand. <br><br> "There's nothing wrong with me. Even if I feel particularly painful, I still have to accept the reality. Life doesn't give me many choices." Day said in an almost self-deprecating tone. <br><br> "How can I help you?" Gee asked. <br><br> "Just don't be angry with me." The young man said from the bottom of his heart. He knows that escaping is not good, even his closest friends will be disappointed, but everyone has a time when they can't get out. Gee didn't answer but just held Day's hand tightly. That was probably the best answer between them. <br><br> "Does anyone else in the university know about this? What about August, your partner? Have you told him?" Gee asked when the car stopped at the university. <br><br> "He didn't know, I didn't tell anyone." <br><br> The young man stated that he did not want anyone to know about it except his family and doctors. And maybe Mhok, who's sitting here right now. His good friend Gee sighed, probably wondering who Mhok was, but didn't have the courage to ask. <br><br> "Do you want to go to the university together? They are cleaning the badminton club now, and the coach is asking the athletes to take their medals and trophies home. Do you want to go and see them? Your cabinet is full of awards." <br><br> A good friend of his and a teammate of his badminton team extended the invitation. Day thought quietly for a long time. Returning to college might mean running into a lot of familiar faces and his secrets will no longer be secrets. But thinking from another angle, he can't live in this dark world forever. <br><br> "Well, I miss the club a lot too." <br><br> Gee walks ahead and becomes Day's tour guide back in time. I don't know whether it's good or bad, but today is Sunday. There are very few people in the university and no one shows up. Moreover, the badminton club also sent people to participate in charity matches. His best friend expertly led the way, Mhok following behind. After walking for a while, Mhok went to the bathroom, while Gee and Day waited quietly in the corner of the school building. J asked quietly while laughing. <br><br> "Have you ever taken a closer look at what he looks like?" <br><br> "Gee, are you kidding? I can barely see anything with my eyes." Day laughed. <br><br> "You said before that you can still see it if you're close," Gee retorted. <br><br> "Then what do you want me to do? Get close to his face and look at it?" <br><br> The young man argued that he remembered only the outline of Mhok, like the sketch of a painting. He relied on his imagination to fill in the rest of the story to prevent him from feeling embarrassed when he recalled it later. To him, Mhok looked like a rough-looking man he had seen in movies about urban evil. <br><br> "He's really handsome, you know?" Ke said softly, "What should I say? Your Mhok brother is really handsome. I think he must be more handsome than you think. From the beginning, I was Think about it, why would such a person come to be your caregiver! His appearance is really very high-end." <br><br> Day's good friend sighed. Mhok happened to come back at this time, so they had to end the conversation. They walked together to the sports ground leading to the badminton club. The smell of boxing oil, sweat, and hot, humid air hit my face. It was the same place as before, nothing had changed. Day smiled unconsciously. He has been with the badminton court since he can remember, and it seems to be his second home. He climbed all the way to the position of the national team, but the sudden failure made him fall from the top of the mountain, even though he was only a stone's throw away from victory. "I thought you said you were a badminton player and just played casually at home, but I didn't expect you to be so professional. <br><br> Mhok said as Gee left to answer the phone. The two of them stood in front of the club, where they were waiting for someone to collect their trophies and medals. <br><br> "Oh, brother, do you know who I am? I am Danaiyanat Koprannaphakun, a national member of the youth badminton team. Almost all the trophies and medals in this room have my name, and everyone calls me the prince of badminton." Day said , showing a bright smile. <br><br> "Young man, you can keep a low profile." <br><br> "The young badminton prince doesn't like to belittle himself. Just go in, brother, and I will prove to you that I am not exaggerating." <br><br> Day pushed Mhok into the club. As soon as he entered the familiar environment, even though his vision was blurred, memories emerged like ripples, as if he could see every detail with his eyes. The corner at the back of the closet where he likes to sleep, the equipment box where he often sneaks his rackets, and even the conference table where he and his friends often place a barbecue grill remain unchanged. He has been denying his identity since losing his sight, but in fact, he can never escape his past self. <br><br> Day walked towards the destination in his heart, even with his eyes closed. An old cabinet stood solemnly to one side, filled with trophies and medals. He stroked it proudly until he touched a trophy at the top of the cabinet. All that was left of that trophy was an ear, and he still remembered it. He put his face close to the trophy, probably no more than a foot away, which was as close as he could get a clear view. His name is engraved there as evidence that he once lived a life full of hope and victory. <br><br> "Who did Day play with before, was it Gee?" Mhok asked, probably because he saw someone else's name on the trophy. <br><br> "Another friend, his name is August." <br><br> The young man replied, feeling confused inside. He competed with August, and they made it to the professional tournament together. And his sudden disappearance was like breaking August's wings suddenly, making him farther and farther away from victory. If compared to all the people in the world, August was the person he least wanted to see. <br><br> "That's it." Mhok accepted the answer, but he didn't quite know the story. <br><br> "I'll just take this one back." <br><br> Day said, picking up the trophy with only one ear left. As for why there was only one ear, it was because when they took the trophy back to the university to take pictures after the victory, everyone fought for it. He and August grabbed it together, but the trophy fell and hit the floor, and the coach got angry because of it. But that gave that game a different memory than other games. <br><br> "Let's go back. I'll call Gee later." <br><br> Day held the trophy in one hand and grabbed Mhok's arm with the other, preparing to leave the club. But when he raised his head, he noticed the shadow of a person in front of the club room door. At first he thought it was Gee, but it didn't look like it from the outside. Mhok politely asked the other party to give way, but the other party remained silent. Day felt a surge of anger wash over him, and although he could remember what the other person looked like, deep down he still hoped he was wrong. He didn't want to be so unlucky to "hit the jackpot" after returning to college for the first time. <br><br> "Day..where did you disappear to!" <br><br> That was the last thing Day wanted to hear, and a chill ran through him from head to toe. Mhok turned to him and asked in a low voice if he needed help, but he replied that he didn't. No matter what, this day would come, but it came so quickly that he had no time to prepare mentally. <br><br> "August...do you remember when I fainted during the competition in Singapore?" He used this as his opening remarks to his partner whom he had not seen for a long time. <br><br> "I remember very clearly that you disappeared after that day." August's tone was full of complaints. <br><br> "I have severe keratitis and now my vision is only 40 percent. The doctor said that after a while, I may be completely blind. <br><br> The room in the badminton club suddenly became very quiet, as if everyone present had forgotten how to breathe. Day couldn't pick up the emotion directly on his past partner's face, but something told him intuitively that August was confused. <br><br> "Then why didn't you tell me? Why did you disappear suddenly? Didn't you say that the two of us were best friends? Why on earth? You left me here alone, - don't tell me anything, Day! You told Me, I have been waiting for you for six months without finding a new partner. In order to wait for you to come back, I have lost so many opportunities as a badminton player. Day... you answer me!" <br><br> August walked right over, grabbed Day's shoulders and shook him back and forth, causing the trophy with their names engraved on it to fall to the ground again. Once, one ear of the trophy was broken because of the victorious laughter of the two of them, but today, the other ear may be broken because of the irreparable gap between the two. <br><br> "Do you think that because you are blind, I should forgive you...Day!"

		"Teacher, don't think too much. You have already done a good job. At that time, your mental state may not be very good. Your friend is just a little dissatisfied. Wait for him to go back to sleep and think about it for a day or two. , he will understand. Oh, teacher, my eyes are almost blind, and I am not suffering from a small cold. Who can be as strong as steel and diamonds."﻿ <br><br> Aon said this while teaching Day Braille. Day has learned the basics of Braille and is now practicing writing Braille on paper notebooks. The sound of tools hitting paper and relaxing music play in the living room. <br><br> "Teacher Aon, what's one or two days? You've been missing for more than a week. Have you stopped doing things?" Day complained. <br><br> "It's okay if you don't practice. You, don't think too much. We can't take care of everyone in our lives. No matter how much we love each other, there will always be people who slowly leave our lives. I think I can accept this. Teacher ,have you heard of it?" <br><br> Aon responded, continuing to hum. Day and Mhok sat aside and couldn't help but laugh softly. Actually, Teacher Aon is right. Day had done his best to just understand and accept his old partner's decision. <br><br> "Teacher Aon seems a little strange recently. Is he fascinated by someone? It doesn't seem very believable!" Mhok joked. <br><br> "It's okay, but have you ever heard that people in love often look younger?" Aon continued humming. <br><br> "Wow, Teacher Aon, do you have a girlfriend?" Day asked excitedly. <br><br> "Oh, as for my girlfriend, I already have one, Teacher. She is here to guide me in running competitions. We have been dating for a long time. At this stage, there is no problem." Aon said calmly. <br><br> "If we have been together for so long, why is this happening all of a sudden?" Mhok said with a smile. <br><br> "I mentioned the proposal a little bit recently, and I feel like she agrees with it. I want to propose right after the next game. She definitely didn't expect that she might think that I would be traveling or eating at a luxury restaurant. It's time to propose. You know so little about me, little ones." Aon's tone was filled with the happiness of love. <br><br> "Really, Teacher Aon? Can a sighted person and a blind person really spend their lives together?" Day whispered, as if he was asking himself, rather than really wanting an answer from someone else. <br><br> "What's going on? Who told me that I shouldn't criticize myself? Day, aren't you criticizing yourself now?" Mhok retorted jokingly. <br><br> "Day, we shouldn't think that blind people are inferior to people with normal vision. Love is not only based on vision, character and heart are more important. Besides, when the lights are turned off, everyone is invisible, right? ?" Aon's words left Day speechless. Regarding love, he also has his own thoughts. Although he had had such thoughts, when he knew that he was about to become blind, he closed the door for himself. Who would be willing to accept the other half in this state? Real love seems to only exist in romance novels. <br><br> Mhok was about to say something, but before he could say anything, the doorbell rang. The only person visible in the room is responsible for opening the door. Day sat back and continued recording in Braille. They'd been chatting for so long that they had to reread it and write it down, and he was jotting down a summary of the book "Last Twilight." <br><br> "Day." <br><br> At first, Day thought it was Mhok calling him, but judging by his gait and the sound of the door closing, he guessed otherwise. Also, the man about an arm's length away didn't smell faintly of tobacco, but instead smelled like the painkiller patches commonly used by athletes. <br><br> "Is it August?" he asked with a hint of recognition in his voice. <br><br> "I'm very sorry." <br><br> The other party responded, which made him more certain that the person in front of him was his old partner. <br><br> "I was too impulsive before. Looking back, you should have suffered more than me." <br><br> "I'm also sorry for my sudden disappearance, I'm really sorry," Day responded. <br><br> "It doesn't matter, I was so angry that I don't remember anything." <br><br> August smiled, then pulled Day into a familiar hug, which they used to do when they needed to cheer each other up. Especially when they lost that important game, that defeat hit harder than any other. Day and August are both experiencing darkness in their lives. One has lost a great opportunity as an athlete, while the other is suffering from illness. They are both equally matched by each other. <br><br> "You guys, have you been exercising? Where have all the muscles in your arms gone? You can't catch the ball anymore, right?" <br><br> August joked, pulling Day to sit on the sofa and chat. Day introduced Mhok and Aon to August and then continued. <br><br> "If your eyes are going to go blind, do you still have the heart to continue exercising? You should be more worried about whether I can catch the ball, rather than whether I can catch it well, August?" As time went by, he began to gradually Get used to questions about your eyes. <br><br> "Is there really no way to treat it?" August asked seriously. <br><br> "In fact, corneas can be transplanted through surgery, because you need to wait for someone to donate, but there are so many people waiting in line to buy it. Moreover, they will give priority to treating people who are completely blind. My vision is only weakened, and I have to wait until they treat those who are completely blind. , it will be my turn, do you think I should pray that I will become completely blind as soon as possible?" <br><br> The young man joked humorously, but the person he was talking to knew it was not funny at all. August hugged Day again, caressing Day's back with his hand, telling him over and over again that there was someone there for him. Day couldn't suppress his tears. The torture of the illness made him forget his family and friends during this difficult journey, and that there were still people who were willing to accompany him and support him. <br><br> Day wiped away tears and tried to calm down, while August tried to bring the mood back to where it was before with small talk. <br><br> "Do you remember the Peleor Beber restaurant? That very luxurious restaurant. We once promised to eat there together if we won the international competition." August asked. <br><br> "Remember, it's not cheap and it's hard to get a reservation." He smiled. <br><br> "I have reserved two places. Let's go eat together this Saturday." <br><br> Day was a bit overwhelmed by August's direct invitation. Today is already Wednesday, and there are only a few days left before the day he mentioned. The problem is that Day has never eaten out at a restaurant with anyone before. <br><br> "Oh, are you too anxious? I have never seen an international competition." Day said jokingly. <br><br> "But in the recent game I won, I won the men's badminton singles. Now I only participate in men's singles and mixed doubles, and will give up the men's doubles temporarily." <br><br> As much as Day wanted not to be happy about something so selfish, he couldn't. He admits he's glad August didn't find someone else to take his place. <br><br> "Okay, let's just think of it as celebrating you: let's be AA." <br><br> It is with this paradox that Day accepts August's invitation. After sitting for a while, Aon's lunch order was served. Day jokingly invites August to eat with him, even though he knows that August doesn't usually eat food outside of his meal plan unless it's a special occasion. So after a while, the other party resigned and went back. In fact, deep down, Day didn't want to eat casually in front of his ex-partner. <br><br> "I have to stay here tonight. Brother Night told me. He said he had something to do and asked me to stay and help take care of the house." <br><br> As Mhok said this, he gave Day some pizza and grabbed his hand to show which one was chili sauce and which one was ketchup. <br><br> "I'll do it myself, I'll do it myself, who am I to you?" Day complained as he picked up the onion ring and put it in his mouth. <br><br> "Anyway, I'm going to stay here tonight and probably sleep in the living room," Mhok said. <br><br> "There is a ghost in the living room, did I tell you? When the house was first built, a pregnant worker fell to death here. No one at home would stay in the living room at night, especially late at night. You would often hear something like someone giving birth. "I cried out in pain," Day said as he rolled up the pizza so he could eat it. <br><br> "Really?" Mhok whispered. <br><br> "Of course it's not true." Day laughed, very happy. This made Mhok slightly unhappy, but he didn't say anything because they knew each other well. "If you want to sleep, you can sleep in my room. There is room on the bed anyway. If a robber with a gun breaks in and wants to kill me, you can help in time." Day looked very relaxed. <br><br> "Then when Brother Night is here, will he sleep in your room?" <br><br> "No." The young man shrugged. <br><br> "What if a robber breaks into your room?" Mhok chased. <br><br> "Night may want me dead, don't you know? He may have planned to send robbers to rob the house tonight. You should also prepare your gun and knife just in case." <br><br> Day looked happy and got up and went back to his room and told Mhok that he wanted to sleep during the day and did not want to be disturbed and that he would tell him if he needed anything. Afterwards, Mhok leaves to see Teacher Aon home. Meanwhile, Day fell asleep quietly. When he woke up again, it was completely dark, and a knock on the door woke him up. He could barely sleep because of August's incident before, but now he was sleeping deeply and didn't know what happened. <br><br> "May I come inside?" <br><br> After hearing this question, there was another knock on the door. -Day sleepily walked over and opened the door for Mhok. Mhok comes into the room and asks where he should sleep. <br><br> "You have to figure it out yourself." <br><br> Day replied without thinking before hopping on the bed and putting on his headphones to continue listening to the podcast he had paused. He squinted and thought Mhok would be sleeping on the floor next to the bed, near the window. This way he could keep vigil to prevent robbers from entering, as he had joked before. <br><br> "Be free, brother, you can do whatever you want. But if you want to smoke, you'd better endure it, or you can go out and smoke, and remember to take a shower." The owner of the room warned. <br><br> "I'm not that big of a smoker, don't be too exaggerated, okay?" the other party complained. <br><br> "Brother, you smell like cigarettes. If you don't have a craving for cigarettes, what should you say?" <br><br> Day said casually and Mhok wrinkled his nose and smelled his clothes. Then he pretended not to know what was going on, maybe because he lost the confidence to say that he had no craving for cigarettes, and suggested that he should take a shower first. The owner of the room pretended to be asleep, as if he had done something wrong. He suddenly felt inexplicably awkward being alone with Mhok. <br><br> After taking a shower, Mhok lay on the mattress on the floor and tried to chat with Day, but Day still pretended to be asleep. After a while, Mhok also became quiet. Day picked up the phone with the earphones connected and checked it, and found that it was almost midnight. <br><br> Suddenly Gee's question came into his mind, "Have you ever seen his face clearly?" <br><br> "Brother Mhok..." <br><br> The young man pretended to call softly, but received no response. He moved slowly, as gently as possible, on the bed. His caregiver lay there, but he could only vaguely see it. Day slowly moved closer, his vision becoming clearer. He continued to get closer, and the person in front of him became clearer, until the distance between them was less than a finger's throw away. It was the first time he'd seen Mhok- clearly since they'd met. <br><br> If they accept each other without any prejudice, everything will be as Gee said. Mhok was very good looking, beyond his imagination. <br><br> Day felt his heart beat faster...but he didn't know why.

		<p> 
		"Peleor Beber restaurant? Wow, these food are very expensive."﻿ <br><br> The nurse smelling of cigarette smoke said, while Day looked aimlessly at the goldfish in the fish tank. His goldfish Geensay gets along really well with his new friend Nozomi and seems to be more active with his new friend. <br><br> "This is French cuisine, a high-end restaurant. But I think it's troublesome for me to just eat ordinary noodles, let alone pasta." Day complained. <br><br> "It's okay, Day, you two are good friends, it's not a problem." Mhok tried to comfort the young man, but Day had no other response than silence and sighs. Day tapped on the glass to call Geensay over, but Nozomi, the new goldfish, swam over. <br><br> "Would you like to take a look at the menu first? There should be some things that are easier to eat. Day, you can choose for yourself." <br><br> After hearing this, Day thought it was feasible. He asked Mhok to read the names of the dishes on the menu to him one by one, imagining that he was enjoying these dishes slowly. He thinks the easiest thing and what he eats most often is steak. Mhok helped him plan and organize the upcoming Saturday, down to every detail, even what to wear. Since the PeleorBeber restaurant requires decent attire for dining, Mhok and Day chose their clothes carefully. Young people want to dress appropriately, but not look too formal. <br><br> The young man spent a long time choosing and finally made a decision, choosing a shirt, trousers and casual shoes. All that's left is to wait for the appointed time to arrive. During the four days from Wednesday to Saturday, Day both wants to go by quickly and slowly. On the one hand, he hopes that the appointed time will come soon. On the other hand, he felt worried. Having not seen August's face clearly for almost a year, he had almost forgotten the broad face. Deep down in his heart, he wanted to see that smiling face again, even though he knew it was almost impossible. <br><br> "Will you come with me?" Day asked when Saturday arrived. <br><br> "Yes, this is within the scope of my responsibilities." Mhok replied calmly, unable to feel his emotions. <br><br> "Then will you always wait for me there, or will you pick me up after I leave?" Day hesitated. <br><br> "Then will you always wait for me there, or will you pick me up after I leave?" Day hesitated. <br><br> "I'll be waiting for you in the car, just near the restaurant. If anything happens to Day, you can call me. You can tell me whenever you want to come back. Or if you have any questions and need help, you can call me anytime. , I'm always on call." <br><br> Hearing these words, the young man's face showed a smile for the first time in these days. Day asked Mhok to help him check whether he was dressed properly before getting into the car. <br><br> Day's heart was pounding, especially when he arrived at the restaurant and the waiter took him to his seat. Everything in the restaurant was eye-catching. The aroma of fresh butter filled the shop, and soft classical music played continuously. The people inside talked to each other in French-accented English, and the sounds floated softly into his ears. The scene in the restaurant blurred before his eyes, and Day slowly began to focus on every little detail around him. <br><br> "I'll wait for you in the parking lot. If you need anything, tell me." Mhok said after Day settled down. He borrowed a car from Night as usual. August's agreed time was ten o'clock in the evening, but they arrived at nine-thirty, so Mhok spent a lot more time waiting in the car. <br><br> "Don't smoke too much and watch your lungs," Day said, only half joking. <br><br> "Are you concerned about your lungs? How do you know if I smoke more or less?" The other party was not to be outdone. <br><br> "No matter whose lungs it is, it's the same. In the past two or three days, the smell of smoke on your body is stronger than at any other time." <br><br> The young man said with a chuckle, thinking that the person in front of him would reply with some harsh words. But no. Mhok was unusually silent, so silent that Day felt like he was interfering too much in other people's lives. His breathing became heavy and he felt uncomfortable. The blurred vision prevented him from accurately capturing the other person's emotions. Day wanted to say sorry several times, but on the other hand, he also felt that what he said was not so extreme as to make Mhok angry. <br><br> "I'll wait for you in the car." A calm voice sounded, and then the familiar figure slowly left. The young man was at a loss and could only pick up a napkin and wipe it. A headset is plugged into one ear to hear the hourly time. He focused back on the matter at hand. Mhok had told the waiter that he needed help from the chef to cut his steak into the right size for easy consumption, and that there should be no problem. <br><br> The waiter brought a glass of soda water, and the young man took it and took a sip, as if he wanted to relieve the heat in his heart. As for the source of this heat, he himself wasn't sure where it came from. <br><br> It's already two o'clock... <br><br> August hadn't arrived yet, and Day was a little hesitant to contact him, but he decided to sit quietly and wait. The other party may have heard the slight sound of rain because of the traffic jam. The young man called the waiter to ask, and then he realized that it was really raining outside. <br><br> It's already half past two... <br><br> August still hasn't arrived. Day decided to call his former partner, but when no one answered, he began to feel something strange. I called several times, but no one answered. He felt that he had misremembered the agreed date, so Day called Mhok to confirm because he was also present, but he confirmed that August did make an appointment today. <br><br> It's already three o'clock... <br><br> August hasn't arrived yet, and the previously pounding heartbeat has calmed down. Day couldn't think of anything else except that he thought the other party wanted to tease him and deliberately asked him out and then disappeared. <br><br> August may not have truly forgiven him yet. Day laughed bitterly and leaned back in his chair. <br><br> It's already half past three... <br><br> In half an hour, the restaurant will be closed. The waiter came over and asked if the steak he had ordered should be served now or taken away. The young man didn't want to be talked about behind his back, so he decided to let the waiter serve the food directly. But he didn't really want to eat it. If he forced himself to eat it, he would only feel heartache. <br><br> "If you keep it for a long time, it will become too hard and not tasty." <br><br> "Is it Brother Mhok?" <br><br> A voice came from not far away. He turned to look at the speaker's friend and saw a vague figure standing there. Although this was not the voice he was expecting, Day still felt a little relieved. Mhok pulled up a chair and sat where August should have been, then took a sip of the water he had been served. <br><br> "Then what should I do with this plate? It's such a waste. If the person I made the appointment doesn't come, I'm going to eat it. This level of meat is not cheap. It can fill up the gas of my motorcycle and run for a month." Mhok complained, Pick up the knife and fork as if to eat. <br><br> "Is there a lot of seasoning mixed in, brother? I haven't tasted it yet." <br><br> "Huan will tell you. If you want to know Wen Shao's answer, Tai Zhengzi, I can't see clearly what Day's alliance has." <br><br> Mhok said, raising his hand to ask the waiter to come over and ask for salt and pepper. Day took the opportunity to order another glass of red wine, and Mhok laughed. <br><br> "I thought you wanted orange juice with steak again, what's wrong? Do you want to get drunk or enjoy the delicious food?" <br><br> "I won't tell you, but if you want to know, let's eat together, so you know whether I want to get drunk or enjoy the delicious food." <br><br> Day responded to Mhok's words teasingly, and Mhok laughed again. They both took the first bite of steak with their forks and almost said "delicious" at the same time. <br><br> Even though it took a long time to cook, the taste is still very good. It's fat and thin, which is the benefit of Hishi's cooking skills. Although it's a little dry on the outside, it's still juicy on the inside. <br><br> "This must be a prank show," Day said, raising a second glass of wine and drinking it. <br><br> "Day, drink less, drink slower. Mhok tried to stop it, but Day didn't care. The uneasiness inside made him feel like he wanted to drink more, like alcohol was something special that could heal the wounds in his heart. It hurt. The waiter came in and told them that it was four o'clock sharp. If they wanted to eat anything more, this was the last time to order. The meal could continue, but please don't take it too long. Mhok replied that there was nothing more, But Day suddenly changed his mind. <br><br> "Three more glasses of the same wine." He said and laughed. <br><br> "Day!" Mhok was a little annoyed. <br><br> "What's the matter, brother? I'll have two drinks, and you have one... Or this way, brother, don't you think it's enough? Then I'll have one drink, and you have two." He clearly knew what Mhok was thinking, but he deliberately To irritate the other person. <br><br> "I think Day is already drunk. That's enough. There is no need to drink anymore." Someone tried to reach out and grab the wine glass in his hand, but the young man resisted with all his strength and was unwilling to let the other party take his glass away by force. The two of them pulled at each other like this for several minutes, until the person taking care of him finally gave up and withdrew his hand. Day raised his third glass of wine and drank it in one go. <br><br> "Everything may really be over, bro." <br><br> Mhok didn't respond, but he knew the other person was listening. <br><br> "When I couldn't see anything at first, I chose to run away because I was afraid of knowing the truth. To this day, I feel ready, I feel like I can accept everything. But when it comes, I still bear it No." <br><br> The young man spoke for a long time while trying not to make his voice tremble, but he couldn't. He felt like a complete failure today. Day tried not to cry, even though he knew the other person could easily detect it. <br><br> "I've been deceiving myself, saying I'm just blind, brother. I'm just blind, I just can't see. No matter it's the people around me or whoever, all the problems originate from me. I'm just deceiving myself, brother. Who he Would Mom want to date a blind man? No matter where I go, I can feel the strange eyes of others." He laughed at himself. <br><br> "I don't think you're weird," Mhok retorted. <br><br> "That's because brother, you are just starting to understand me now. If you had known me earlier, maybe you would have left me long ago." Day continued. <br><br> "That's not the case, Day. Think about Gee, she's nice to you too." <br><br> "But Gee and August are different, brother Mhok, do you understand?" <br><br> He had tried his best not to show his vulnerability in front of others. But it's completely useless. The young man felt tears flowing from his eyes, sliding down the bridge of his nose and falling down his cheeks. Day will deny everything in the world, but he will never deny the true feelings in his heart. He picked up the fourth glass of wine and poured it into his mouth. <br><br> "I have always liked August, and I have never regarded him as just a friend." Day vented all the depression and uneasiness in his heart, and all the things he worked hard to build and maintain were like a carefully built sandcastle in the desert. The waves destroy mercilessly. From now on, he may not even be able to retain friendship. The blurrier his vision became at the moment, the more restless the young man felt. He wanted to stand up and violently overturn the table in front of him, leaving it as messy as his heart. <br><br> "Day..." Mhok was about to say something, but at this moment, the mobile phone placed at the door of the store rang. Heavy footsteps approached, and even though there was only a trace of reason left in his heart, Day still heard a movement clearly, and a heavy voice clearly called out his name. <br><br> "Day.." The owner of this voice is August.

		"Do you think August heard what I said?"﻿ <br><br> Day asked Mhok the next day. He was very drunk last night, but he still remembered that he accidentally let it slip. He didn't expect August to arrive at the restaurant at that exact moment. Day pretended to be drunk and asked Mhok to take him home. But even though he drank a lot, he was always sober. He learned that August had seriously injured his finger during practice and had to go to the hospital as soon as possible, and left his phone in the closet, so he didn't receive his call. Other than the fact that he accidentally said everything last night, it didn't seem too bad. <br><br> "I don't know either, Day, my back was turned to him." <br><br> Mhok's voice was strangely calm. <br><br> "You didn't lie to me, right?" Day asked with a hint of doubt. <br><br> "No, why would I lie to you?" <br><br> But why did he think there was something abnormal about Mhok's voice? <br><br> "Can you come to my place for a moment?" <br><br> Day said softly as a joke, Mhok sat in another corner of the living room, stood up and walked to Day. Before he could stop, Day took his face in her hands and slowly pulled him closer. When the distance between them was no more than a foot away, Day's eyes met Mhok's. Day wanted to see the emotion of the person in front of him, but Mhok's eyes seemed to have no reaction to August's matter, and It showed a sadness, a sadness he didn't understand. <br><br> "Your eyes are a little strange and seem sad. What happened to you?" he asked. <br><br> "My parents have passed away, my sister has also passed away, I myself have been in jail, and now I am heavily in debt, and I can't pay it back no matter what." Mhok seemed to be laughing at himself. <br><br> "I'm talking about things I don't know yet. Are you worried about anything at the moment?" Day thought so because Mhok's eyes showed what he was worried about. <br><br> "No...but even if there is, I won't tell Day. If I tell you, then it will become something you know." <br><br> Mhok smiled when he finished speaking, but the young man saw no happiness in his expression. He was about to say something in rebuttal when the bell rang. Mhok made an excuse to go out to pick up Aon, saying that today Teacher Aon would bring some Braille* books for Day to try to practice reading. <br><br> (*Louis Braille, also translated as Braille, is the inventor of Braille, a world-wide writing system used by blind and visually impaired people. Braille is a writing system that is touched by readers with their fingers. A method of reading text consisting of raised dots. This system has been adapted to almost all known languages.) <br><br> "Day. " <br><br> Just after the living room door opened, Day heard someone calling his name. In fact, he heard Aon and Mhok talking about something else, but that call sent shivers down his spine, even if it was mixed in with the voices of other people in the room. <br><br> That voice belongs to August... <br><br> "We met Day's friend at the door, and I heard he was also an athlete," Aon said. <br><br> "Teacher Aon told me that he will go for a run. Day, I think you should also go for exercise. You haven't exercised for two years, right? Don't you feel a lot of pressure? Go and vent, you will feel much better." August Say it in a normal tone! Everything was normal, as if he hadn't seen or heard anything last night. <br><br> "You said it easily, and you don't care about my current state." Day also tried his best to act normal. <br><br> "Do you want to try it? I can be your runner." <br><br> "What do you mean?" <br><br> "Brother, are you talking about me?" <br><br> "I'm talking about nothing, Day, why are you being so sentimental?" <br><br> Mhok's tone became lighter, and even though the two were still bickering, Day's hanging heart relaxed. So, the two began to have lunch. Today, Day decided to eat noodles. He felt that he could no longer escape. He must try his best to do everything well. <br><br> "Are you eating with your mouth or with your face? You see it's all over your face, and it's almost on your eyebrows." Mhok said with a chuckle. <br><br> "Eating these slippery noodles is like going to war. It's difficult to even use a spoon and fork, let alone chopsticks and spoons. It took so long to make a mess, but I still don't feel full." <br><br> "Wait a minute, I'll feed you. If you eat like this, you won't be able to finish it until the evening." Mhok said and grabbed Day's hand. <br><br> "Brother, you don't have to help me. If you keep helping me, when can I live alone? Day didn't respond, but Mhok's hand was still holding tightly. <br><br> "Do you really want to live alone?" <br><br> Mhok sounded like he was asking about small, everyday things, like what the weather was like. But Day sensed something else from the question. If he really wanted to answer this question, he might say, yes, he hopes to be an ordinary person as much as possible, no matter how difficult and difficult it is. <br><br> "Brother, do you plan to take care of me for the rest of your life? If only today, when brother pays off the car loan, he can live a good life. I know that no one is willing to do such a job, not even my mother and brother. Otherwise, why would they Do I want to hire you?" Day said a series of words, bringing the conversation between the two to an end. Mhok did not continue to argue, but he still tried to feed Day with chopsticks. Day resisted vigorously, preventing the other party from doing what he didn't want to do. <br><br> "I'm just going to feed you today and hold Day's hand tightly so that Day can remember this feeling and distance. I know Day doesn't want me to take care of you for the rest of my life. I don't like to force others to do something they can't do." Something you're willing to do." <br><br> Perhaps it was because of Mhok's words that Day loosened his hand that was originally strong. Mhok held Day's hand tightly and moved, smoothly bringing the noodles to Day's mouth. Everything went smoothly in silence, Day opened his mouth to chew and remember this moment, and Mhok was thinking about what he was going to say next. <br><br> "Brother, do you want to go running with us?" Day asked before the new topic started. <br><br> "Go ahead, it sounds fun. It's also a good opportunity to exercise after work. It's worth a try." Mhok said, and Day smiled. He finished the noodles easily and thanked Mhok for his help and for being willing to run with him as a friend. For some reason, Day felt a little strange without Mhok by his side. Mhok has become his support, always helping and supporting him. His presence is like a magical talisman, ensuring that everything goes smoothly. <br><br> Day is looking forward to it more and more, waiting with excitement for the promised day to arrive. On the appointed day, his excitement had not diminished at all. <br><br> "Is it tight enough?" his caregiver asked as he tied Day's shoes. Now, the young man's wrist has been firmly tied to August's body with a guide rope, and everything is ready. Aon and his partner taught basic running techniques and prepared before splitting because it feels more freeing. Now, on the park track, it was just the three of them-Day, August and Mhok. <br><br> "Let's do it," August said, pulling gently on the guide rope. Day moved along. In the beginning, everything was uncertain. However, with every step, the good feeling from before gradually returned to the body. <br><br> "Go forward about ten steps and we'll start to turn left." <br><br> His runner gave such a hint in advance. Combined with body language signals, running for the visually impaired is not as difficult as imagined. Day felt an indescribable freedom, and he didn't know if it was because he started sweating, as August said, or because he was doing something he hadn't thought he would do since his eyesight failed. <br><br> "How are you?" August asked. <br><br> "I'm fine, I'm enjoying it," Day replied. <br><br> They chatted along the way, Mhok not far behind. He was taciturn and barely participated in the conversation between Day and August until they sat down to rest after a few laps and Mhok excused himself to the bathroom. <br><br> "you..." <br><br> August hesitated while Day drank water to quench his thirst. He turned to look in the direction of the sound. He could only see vague outlines and couldn't understand the other person's eyes. <br><br> "I'm sorry for what happened before... let's have another meal together." August continued. Day tried to analyze his tone but couldn't capture the exact message. He had absolutely no way of telling whether August heard what he said that day. But if August heard it, then it might be a hint that two people went to eat alone. <br><br> "Again?" Day said with a playful smile. <br><br> "This time I won't break the promise like before." <br><br> The voice was deep and firm, stirring up hidden emotions deep within Day. All the images from the past came flooding back-those days when they'd run laps together on the playground, compete against each other until dawn, cheer when they won the qualifiers, or hug each other and cry when they lost to August. August is mixed in Day's memories and emotions and cannot be easily let go. <br><br> Day promised him again.
